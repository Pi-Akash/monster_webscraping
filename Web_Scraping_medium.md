#### Importing all the relevent Python Packages


```python
# Importing BeautifulSoup4 to help scrape the webpage
# can be installed using "pip install beautifulsoup4"
# or for people who are using anaconda environment "conda install -c anaconda beautifulsoup4"
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup 

# Importing urllib3 to 'GET' and 'POST' request to or fro from the websites
# can be installed using "pip install urllib3"
# or for people who are using anaconda environment "conda install urllib3"
import urllib3 

#The below line will remove all the Insecure Request Warnings while Requesting a website for scraping
urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

# Importing Pandas Package to convert all the data into DataFrames so as to easily handle the data.
# pip : "pip install pandas"
# anaconda : "conda install pandas"
import pandas as pd
from pandas import DataFrame, Series

# Importing collections package to convert the extracted data into an ordered dictionary which is further used to 
# create DataFrames
from collections import OrderedDict

# Importing time module to provide a pause in between the scraping of 2 links.
import time
```

#### Creating a BeautifulSoup Object or "Soup" as the community calls it, to extract data


```python
# The below line is used to make requests to multiple hosts or multiple requests to the same host.
# The PoolManager will take care of Pools so that we don't have to do it manually. 
http = urllib3.PoolManager()

# We are Specifying the base URL that is what we are going to scrape
base_url = "https://www.monsterindia.com/jobs-in-bangalore-1.html"

# Requesting the website using the Base URL
response = http.request("GET",base_url)

# Creating the soup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.data,"lxml")
#print(soup)
```

#### Uncomment this cell for customized scraping


```python
# finding no of jobs and no of pages to scrape
# print("  No of Job Entries  ".center(110,"."))
# num_entries = int(soup.find("div",{"class" : "count pull-left"}).getText().strip()[10:-7])
# print(num_entries)
# print(type(num_entries))

# print("  No of Pages to Scrape  ".center(110,"."))
# num_of_entries_in_a_page = 40
# num_pages = num_entries // num_of_entries_in_a_page
# print(num_pages)
# print(type(num_pages))
```

#### Creating a new Soup to scrape first 2 pages


```python
# Creating a Dataframe which will be further updated with the extracted data.
monster_df = pd.DataFrame()

# For reordering the whole DataFrame on the basis of our job, we have created a pallete of column names.
column_names = ["Job Title",
